## **1. Main Project (PBL Context): Building a Student Portfolio Website**

**Project Vision:**  
By the end of this project-based learning module, learners will build a **personal portfolio website** using **HTML and CSS** that:

- Showcases their academic background, skills, and projects  
- Is built using best practices in web structure and accessibility  
- Follows modern, semantic, and clean HTML structure  
- Is suitable for resumes, internship applications, and online presence

> **Today‚Äôs Focus:** Use **semantic HTML tags** and practice **page layout planning** to improve accessibility, clarity, and maintainability of the website structure.

## **2. Today‚Äôs Problem Statement (PSBL)**

### **Standard Problem Statement:**
> Your portfolio website is growing‚Äîbut using only `<div>` and basic tags makes the layout unclear and hard to manage. How can you bring structure, readability, and meaning to your markup?

### **Rewritten as User Stories:**
- *As a developer, I want to use semantic HTML tags so that my code is easier to read and maintain.*  
- *As a student, I want my site to be accessible and logically structured.*  
- *As a user, I want the website layout to be clear and consistent across all pages.*

## **6. Conceptual Explanation (Notes + Code Walkthroughs)**

### üîπ What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML uses tags that describe the **meaning** of the content inside them, improving **accessibility**, **SEO**, and **developer clarity**.

### üîπ Common Semantic Tags

- `<header>`: Top of a page or section (title, logo, nav)  
- `<nav>`: Navigation menus  
- `<main>`: Main content block  
- `<section>`: Thematic grouping of content  
- `<article>`: Self-contained pieces (e.g., blog posts, news articles)  
- `<aside>`: Related secondary content (e.g., sidebars)  
- `<footer>`: Page or section footer

### üîπ Semantic Layout Example

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Jane Doe Portfolio</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#skills">Skills</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a student passionate about building the web.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="projects">
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
        <p>HTML/CSS responsive personal site.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <aside>
      <h4>Quick Links</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#skills">Skills</a></li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 Jane Doe</p>
  </footer>
</body>
```
